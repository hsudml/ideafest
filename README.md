## HSU Digital Media Lab
The Digital Media Lab (DML) has participated in [ideaFest](https://www2.humboldt.edu/ideafest/) with special exhibits since 2018. The goal of the DML is to promote and create visibility for digital projects that students are creating at HSU. If you have a digital project and are interested in being part of ideaFest (or know someone else who does), let us know! You can email us at dml@humboldt.edu.

#### VR Station Showcase 
The launch of the VR Station in March, 2019, was followed up by a showcase of some of the interesting virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and 3D animations projects at Humboldt State. We had exhibits from students and faculty on a variety of topics that demonstrate the innovative work that is being done across the campus.
